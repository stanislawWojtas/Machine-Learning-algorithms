# 🤖Machine Learning guide

## 👀About
This repository contains a set of Jupyter Notebooks exploring Machine Learning algorithms. It is based on a university Machine Learning course and the book Hands-On Machine Learning by Aurélien Géron. The repository is divided into two sections:
- 📓Lectures - theroetical introduction to given topics (mostly in polish)
- 📔Labs – practical implementations of the algorithms


Each Lecture/Lab focuses on a different topic related to Machine Learning.
